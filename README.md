# Two Way Communication ESP8266 Node-RED

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-completed-brightgreen) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)](./LICENSE)

Advanced IoT project using the **MQTT protocol** and **Node-RED dashboard** as part of a **Manufacturing Execution System (MES)** communication simulation. This project demonstrates **two-way communication** between two ESP8266 devices through the **Shiftr.io MQTT broker**, visualized in **Node-RED**.

---

## **Project Overview**

Imagine an electronic assembly factory managed by a **Manufacturing Execution System (MES)** as the central control unit. In this factory, two stations communicate with each other through MQTT, represented by two **ESP8266** devices.

* **Station 1 (ESP DIAZ)**: Controls an **RGB indicator lamp**. The MES (Node-RED) sends color commands, and this station reports the current active color. A **Button A** is used to send a servo position command to the second station.
* **Station 2 (ESP BAYU)**: Controls a **servo motor** to adjust the componentâ€™s position. When **Button B** is pressed, it sends a signal to the lamp station to turn off the LED, marking the completion of the process.

All communication runs **in real-time** via **MQTT and Node-RED**, allowing the MES to coordinate both stations efficiently and responsively.

## **Components Used**

* ESP8266
* Breadboard
* Push Button
* LED RGB
* Servo Motor SG90
* Node-RED
* Shiftr.io
* Arduino IDE

## **Workflows**

### **1. LED Color Control**

1. Node-RED sends a color command to a specific topic.
2. Shiftr.io forwards the message to **ESP DIAZ**.
3. **ESP DIAZ** changes the RGB LED color accordingly.
4. The latest color status is published back to Node-RED and shown on the dashboard.

---

### **2. Servo Position Control**

1. Button A is pressed on **ESP DIAZ**.
2. **ESP DIAZ** sends a servo position command (0 or 180) to a topic.
3. Shiftr.io forwards the command to **ESP BAYU**.
4. **ESP BAYU** moves the servo to the specified position.
5. The servo position status is published back to Node-RED and displayed on the dashboard.

---

### **3. LED Toggle from Servo Station**

1. Button B is pressed on **ESP BAYU**.
2. **ESP BAYU** sends a TOGGLE command to **ESP DIAZ** via MQTT.
3. **ESP DIAZ** turns the LED on or off accordingly.
4. The LED status update is sent back and displayed in Node-RED.
